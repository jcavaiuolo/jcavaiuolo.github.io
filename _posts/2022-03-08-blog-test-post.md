# Free blog on github?

So, for the last couple of weeks i've been going around seeing where and hoy I could resume blogging, and did not need anything fancy. Between a handful of options GitHub Pages showed up on the search results. 

Just like that, you can have a repo that works as a blog, and its free. Done, go, build your free static site. It is not as friendly as other offers, Blogger and Wordpress are much more user friendly. But its simple, and that is what i was looking for.

Finally found (and followed) this blog by Chad Baldwin (https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). Fork >> boom, its up. Done. 

## What i learned in this process.

Apparently GitHub Pages is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and must admit that I failed miserably trying to setup a local install and configure dependencies.

Forking from the above link was a life saver and can get you mostly up to go. The site looks simple out of the box but theres a couple of things to make it a little less plain.
